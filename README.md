Memory Game was created as a Genius Hour project by Jenny Sun, Marilyn Sun, and Lucy Wei in an Introduction to Computer Programming (ICTP) 12 class. 

The goal of Genius Hour was for the students of ICTP 12 to self-learn and discover a topic of our choice relating to the class curriculum. Since Java was the core topic of ICTP 12, my team and I decided to further explore the capabilities of Java by creating a fully-functional, interactive game while using the NetBeans 8.0 IDE.
